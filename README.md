Firefox Edge is a theme for Mozilla Firefox that closely replicates the look of Microsoft Edge (both light & dark themes) without losing any features of Firefox.  
The theme is applied only to the top level visuals, meaning that context, popup etc. menus will keep their default look.

*Firefox Edge has been tested on Windows 10 and Firefox 50.*

## Installation
1. Install the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) addon for Firefox
2. Head to [Firefox Edge](https://userstyles.org/styles/135593/firefox-edge) userstyles page
3. Choose either **Light** or **Dark** from Theme option.
4. Click on **Install with Stylish** to preview or install the theme

*Note: After installing the theme you might need to restart Firefox to correct any visual bugs.*
