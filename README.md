Firefox Edge is a theme for Mozilla Firefox that closely replicates the look of Microsoft Edge (both light & dark themes) without losing any features of Firefox.  
The theme is applied only to the top level visuals, meaning that context, popup etc. menus will keep their default look.

*Firefox Edge has been tested on Windows 10 and Firefox 50.*
